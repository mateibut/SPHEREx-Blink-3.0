# Developing SPHEREx Blink

Work in this checkout. This copy is SPHEREx-Blink-3.0; push only to its `blink3` remote when the user requests publication. Treat SPHEREx-Blink-2.0 as the feature baseline. Read docs/CODEX_PROGRESS.md, docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md and docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md, then verify HEAD and the working tree. Historical instructions imported below describe earlier repositories; the current user's destination and scope take precedence.

Serve frontend/ over HTTP. Preserve index.html, results.html, query parameters and embedded mode. The default workspace is synthetic. Keep it explicitly labelled. Read docs/VALIDATION.md before changing scientific methods, units, or thresholds.

Run every scratch/test_*.mjs with Node and run python -m pytest backend -q with backend/requirements-dev.txt installed. Run the browser regression for navigation changes. Record commands, fixture provenance and untested paths in the progress log.

<!-- Everything below comes from the branch blink-2.0 of mateibut/SPHEREx, a second line of Blink 2.0 work that was merged into this repository on 10 Nov 2026. Where the two halves describe the same thing differently, they describe two different implementations: see docs/MERGE_NOTES.md. -->

# AGENTS.md: durable instructions for anyone (human or agent) working on SPHEREx Blink

Read this, then `docs/CODEX_PROGRESS.md` (where the work stands), then `git status` and `git log`. Do not trust a note that the repository
contradicts; check.

## What this is

A NASA Space Apps 2026 project ("Planet X and SPHEREx"): a blink comparator and mover/source finder for SPHEREx infrared images. Vanilla ES
modules in `frontend/` (no build step, no npm), a FastAPI + astropy backend in `backend/` (optional), Node and pytest tests. Map of the code:
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. What works and what does not: `docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md`. Limits: `docs/SCIENTIFIC_LIMITATIONS.md`. Plan: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`.

## Rules that must not be broken

1. **Real or synthetic, always labelled.** Never present synthetic data, a simulation or a model output as an observation. Never fall back
   silently from real data to synthetic: show what failed. Real SPHEREx files and pixels are **never committed or published**
   (`backend/data/` is git-ignored; the data licence is unchecked). The results page shows derived numbers only.
2. **No invented science.** No made-up FITS columns, endpoints, units, catalogue matches or validation numbers. A number in the docs comes from a
   command that can be re-run (`docs/VALIDATION.md` names it). Facts written from memory are marked as such. A candidate is a lead, never a discovery.
3. **Do not download new FITS files** without the author's explicit yes (file, source, size first). Catalogue queries (SIMBAD, Gaia, IRSA TAP, SkyBoT) are fine.
4. **Never force-push, rewrite history or delete branches.** Push only after the author's fresh, explicit yes, as a plain push to this repository
   (`mateibut/SPHEREx-Blink-3.0`, the branch the author names; an approval for one push does not cover the next). Work on a branch, not on `main`. (The text that stood
   here said "never push, work on the branch `blink-2.0`": that came from an earlier repository and is replaced.) Commit only when asked or when a task says to;
   messages end with the co-author line the tool gives you.
5. **Keep it working.** Existing URLs (`?ra=&dec=&fov=&det=&mode=`, `?data=api&api=`, `?embed=1`) and existing features stay. Run the tests before and after.
6. **Honest tests.** Never mark a test as passing without running it; never weaken a check to make it pass (change it only when the behaviour it
   encodes was meant to change, and say so).

## Commands

```bash
for f in scratch/test_*.mjs; do node "$f" | tail -1; done          # Node tests: PASS/FAIL lines, exit code != 0 on failure
backend/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest backend -q               # backend tests (Python 3.14 venv; `py` is the launcher, `python` is a broken alias)
node scratch/e2e_smoke.mjs                                          # the page in headless Chrome (synthetic demo, Node 22+, no install; not part of the test_*.mjs set); docs/BENCHMARKS.md section 3
node scratch/benchmark.mjs --check                                  # the digests of three searches against scratch/benchmark_baseline.json; --write only when a scientific change was meant
# the Playwright regression (a TEST-ONLY tool, pinned: `npm install playwright@1.59.1` in a folder OUTSIDE the repository, then NODE_PATH=<that folder>/node_modules):
#   py scripts/serve_frontend.py 8765   then   BLINK_BROWSER=chrome node scratch/browser_navigation.cjs   (also browser_layout_audit, _tour_modal, _public_backend, _sky_archive, _simulator_precision,
#   _candidate_roundtrip, _workspace, _all; BLINK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8765/ is the default). A bare index.html redirects to overview.html: use index.html#workspace or a query string.
#   browser_real, _real_responsive and _provenance need the real-data backend (BLINK_REAL_URL) and are not run in CI.

py scripts/serve_frontend.py 8765                                   # frontend, no stale cache (also .claude/launch.json "frontend")
node scratch/calibrate_astrometry.mjs                               # the injection tables of VALIDATION §15 (a minute); scratch/check_astrometry_real.mjs: the same errors on the real fields (needs backend-real)
node scratch/make_results_sources.mjs                               # remake frontend/data/real_sources.json (needs "backend-real" and internet): do it when discovery.js VERSION or a threshold changes, test_results.mjs fails on a stale file
# real-data runs need a real-only backend:  SPHEREX_DATA_DIR=backend/data/real  uvicorn on port 8003  ("backend-real" in .claude/launch.json),
# then e.g.  node scratch/validate_discovery.mjs --mode real --field "Barnard D2"      (VALIDATION.md §14)
```

Open the page with real data: `http://localhost:8765/?data=api&api=http://localhost:8003&ra=269.4462&dec=4.769&fov=5&det=D2`.
`?theme=midnight|nebula|deep-space|observatory|light|classic` picks a colour theme for one visit (Midnight / dark is the default on a first visit; the other five are the Paper palettes).

## Conventions

- UI text and documents in **English**; the author chats in Romanian (answer in Romanian, explain astronomy basics, say what is certain and what is from memory).
- Colours only through the CSS tokens in `frontend/css/styles.css` section 1 (`scratch/test_theme.mjs` checks contrast per theme). Charts keep a dark ground in every theme.
- Analysis code is **pure** (no DOM, no network, `fetch` injectable) in `frontend/js/features/`, so Node can test it; the DOM part is a separate module.
- New feature = code + tests (Node or pytest) + a line in `docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md` + limits in `docs/SCIENTIFIC_LIMITATIONS.md`; a measured claim goes in `docs/VALIDATION.md` with its command.
- Scratch scripts that need real files print a report and are not run in CI. Windows: Git Bash heredocs choke on some quotes; write files with the editor tool.
- Libraries are added only with a pinned version and a licence line in `CREDITS.md`; nothing is deployed or published without the author asking.

## Open decisions (the author's, not code's)

Which repository is final: on 12 Nov 2026 the author named **SPHEREx-Blink-3.0** for later changes (SPHEREx-Blink-2.0 holds a parallel line of work that is not merged here yet); eligibility of work begun before the hackathon (`docs/TODO.md` §1); the data licence and
acknowledgement wording (`CREDITS.md`).
